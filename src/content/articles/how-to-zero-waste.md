## Considerations

- Yes, I currently live in a big city (Brussels)
- Yes, I don't need a car. (don't have one and don't know how to drive either)
- I currently don't own a bike anymore, so I do everything by foot. I sincerly hope its new Neuköllner owner is happy with it.
- When I need to travel big distance, I use the train (easy enough to do so within Belgium and ICE can always get me to BERLIN) Not cheap though but plenty of space in first class (first class is often cheaper than second). I've decided to stop travelling by bus.

## List

- Buy all my groceries in bulk in a bio coop (farm.be) or small market (alimentation géniale).
- Use handmade soaps
- Use powder toot paste (will make my own now)
- Drink water from the tap with charcoal filter or I buy glass bottles which are very cheap)
- Buy second hand clothes/shoes and wear them until they are heavily used or repair them if possible.
- Wrapping gifts in infinitely reusable cloth (used small tablecloth last time for wrapping vinyls)
- Use fancy inox straw (bombilla). Would not recommand for anything else than tea.

## Looking for

- Glass milk bottle

## Things I should stop

- To forget all the things I should bring when going grocery shopping
- Destroying jeans so fast

## Things I'm not so proud of but...

- Bought a pair of `made in england` Dr Martens recently. Happy with them but couldn't choose between plastic made vegetarian like dc martens or original ones.
  I hope to keep them for years anyway as my only pair of shoes.

## Things I do and I wonder if that's useful

- Buy wine from dispenser to refill bottles.

## Other facts

- I sleep in a 100% cotton sleeping bag. (nomad.nl) It's like taking my bed with me when I travel.
- Futon mattress is better than IKEA bed.

## Ideas

### Survivalism

To reduce the number of times I need to go grocery shopping, I should try to get most of the things I need in a year at once.
I should store more dried goods.
